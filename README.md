# TechTonic

## Description

TechTonic is a blog where users can create, view, and comment on posts about the latest in tech. Users can create an account, view posts made by other users, and comment on those posts. Users can also view a dashboard of their own posts, which they can delete if they wish. This app utilizes Sequelize for its database and Handlebars as the engine for its model-view-controller design scheme.
